# Flemish Archive for Annotated Music - Music treatises dataset

This dataset is part of the FAAM (Flemish Archive for Annotated Music) project at the [Royal Conservatoire of Antwerp](https://www.ap-arts.be/en/research/faam-flemish-archive-annotated-music).

The current dataset is an extension of the [FAAM-dataset repository](https://github.com/nicholascornia89/FAAM-dataset), dedicated exclusively to music treatises and their layout analysis. 
The corpus focusses mainly on 19th century and early 20th century European classical music scores with performance indications that are usually subsequent to the original composition.
